# Question

Consider the React component below. Explain the three ways that we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run. For each, provide an example of the dependency array to help explain your answer.

```js
const MyComponent = ({ someProp }) => {
  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }, '???');

  return (
    <div>
      <!-- Some More JSX -->
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Answer
first argument <function> runs after every render

second argument <dependencies> will only run when dependencies in the array change.

dependencies are depended on for a effect function to act.

Therefore 

with a dependency array the effect function will run only when one or more of the dependencies in the array change.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  //'Effect runs when someState or someProp changes';
}, [someState, someProp]);
```

with an empty dependency Array The effect function will run just once, right after the component is initially rendered. 
```js
useEffect(() => {
  //'Effect runs only once after the initial render';
}, []);
```

with no dependency array/ omitted (different from just being empty)the effect runs every-time the component re-renders This means it will execute not only on the initial render but also after every update to state or props.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  //'Effect runs after every render';
});
```
