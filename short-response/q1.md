'useEffect' accepts two arguments. The second one being optional.
useEffect(<function>, <dependencies>) //by design dependencies is always a array.

The first argument being the a back function contains the side affect logic. It is the function that you give 'useEffect'  to handle things other than rendering like  fetching, or DOM.

The dependency is what we pass into useEffect consisting of empty array,array with dependencies and no array. Determines when the effect should be re-run based on the changes made to the elements in the array aka the empty array, array with dependencies and no array.
